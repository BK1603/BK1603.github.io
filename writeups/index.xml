<p>Before starting the discussion of the problem, for anyone following these
blog posts, I&rsquo;d like to mention that everything required by these
challenges can be read as and when necessary, but having a very basic
knowledge of the linux command line, file permission bits on linux and
tools like <code>ssh</code>, <code>scp</code> and <code>nc</code> would be very helpful. Also try reading
the <code>man</code> pages of any command line tool the use of which you couldn&rsquo;t
understand.</p>

<p>Also, all the writeups that I do for these problems would always contain a
section named &ldquo;Hint&rdquo;, it would contain a hint which according to me should
help in solving the problem. If you want to solve a problem but are stuck
somewhere, try looking at these hints and see if you get somewhere with
the problem.</p>

<h2 id="hint">Hint</h2>

<p>The program reads from a file descriptor, what file descriptor can you
modify?</p>

<h2 id="how-i-solved-it">How I solved it</h2>

<p>The title of the first problem at <a href="https://pwnable.kr">pwnable.kr</a> is fd.
If you have even a little experience with linux or have manipulated files in a language like C, you&rsquo;d think that the problem somehow involves file descriptors. And you wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong. Clicking on the problem you&rsquo;d find
the following hint:</p>

<pre><code>Mommy! what is a file descriptor in Linux?

* try to play the wargame your self but if you are ABSOLUTE beginner, follow this tutorial link:
https://youtu.be/971eZhMHQQw

ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)
</code></pre>

<p>Well, before starting anything, I like to download the files present at
the pwnable server to a local directory, so that I can test out my
solutions locally. I did that with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>scp -r -P2222 fd@pwnable.kr:~/ ./
</code></pre>

<p><em>(You can checkout the <code>scp</code> command by running <code>man scp</code> on your terminal, always remember: curiosity is your friend here.)</em></p>

<p>Opening the directory where the files were copied, I saw that the source
file for the binary was given to us. I started out by reading the source
file.</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed in the source was the following <code>if</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>if(argc&lt;2){
	printf(&quot;pass argv[1] a number\n&quot;);
	return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program takes at least one argument as an input. (Hence the check
<code>argc &lt; 2</code>.) From the error message, we can assume that the first argument
that was passed should be a number. Upon reading the code further, I saw that the
program uses the first argument passed to it (<code>argv[1]</code>) in the
following line:</p>

<pre><code>int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
</code></pre>

<p>The code subtracts the hex value <code>0x1234</code> from the first input passed,
and store it in the <code>fd</code> variable. It then uses <code>fd</code> as a file descriptor
and reads 32 bytes from it and stores the value in the buffer buf:</p>

<pre><code>len = read(fd, buf, 32);
if(!strcmp(&quot;LETMEWIN\n&quot;, buf)) {
  printf(&quot;good jon :)\n&quot;);
  system(&quot;/bin/cat flag&quot;);
  exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It outputs the flag if the read string is &ldquo;LETMEWIN&rdquo;. Upon getting here,
I realised that what I can do is, give a value to this program such that
the value of <code>fd</code> becomes 0, which is the file descriptor for <code>STDIN</code>. Then
the program would try to read from the standard input, and I could type
out the string &ldquo;LETMEWIN&rdquo;. Converting <code>0x1234</code> to the decimal number
system, we get <code>4660</code>.</p>

<p>Typing the following into the terminal displays the success message:</p>

<pre><code>./fd 4660
LETMEWIN
good job :)
/bin/cat: flag: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>We get a cat error as we don&rsquo;t have the flag file on our system, we aren&rsquo;t
allowed to copy the flag file to our systems, as we might change the
permissions of that file and simply <code>cat</code> the flag.</p>

<p>Running this code on the ssh session gives us the flag!</p>

<h2 id="a-question">A question</h2>

<p>What happens if we try to cat the <code>flag</code> file directly in the <code>ssh</code>
session? Let&rsquo;s try it out:</p>

<pre><code> ____  __    __  ____    ____  ____   _        ___      __  _  ____  
|    \|  |__|  ||    \  /    ||    \ | |      /  _]    |  |/ ]|    \ 
|  o  )  |  |  ||  _  ||  o  ||  o  )| |     /  [_     |  ' / |  D  )
|   _/|  |  |  ||  |  ||     ||     || |___ |    _]    |    \ |    / 
|  |  |  `  '  ||  |  ||  _  ||  O  ||     ||   [_  __ |     \|    \ 
|  |   \      / |  |  ||  |  ||     ||     ||     ||  ||  .  ||  .  \
|__|    \_/\_/  |__|__||__|__||_____||_____||_____||__||__|\_||__|\_|

fd@pwnable:~$ cat flag
cat: flag: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>We get a permission denied error, obviously we shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to cat
the flag, and using <code>ls -l</code> to check the permissions on this file, we
find that it is in fact the case:</p>

<pre><code>fd@pwnable:~$ ls -l
total 16
-r-sr-x--- 1 fd_pwn fd   7322 Jun 11  2014 fd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root  418 Jun 11  2014 fd.c
-r--r----- 1 fd_pwn root   50 Jun 11  2014 flag
</code></pre>

<p>We see that the flag file is only readable by the owner <code>fd_pwn</code> or by
someone belonging to the <code>root</code> group.</p>

<p>Well if that&rsquo;s the case then how does the <code>fd</code> binary <code>cat</code>s the file? The
answer to that is the <code>s</code> flag. It is called the <code>setuid</code> flag. You can
read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">here</a>.</p>
