      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with code debugging, we all know what code debugging is. We write some code, and then we check for errors (or bugs) in the code and try to fix them or remove them. We want to find and fix these bugs as early in the development process as posssible, because of a well known principle that states that fixing bugs later in the stages of development/release costs more than what it would in the earlier stages.</description>
