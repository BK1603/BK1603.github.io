      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s this? Well, since I have a bit of free time on my hands these days, I am thinking of learing a bit about cryptography. I am always amazed at the way we manipulate strings of bits and bytes in cryptography, to hide a message. That too in plain sight. It always has been a very fascinating thing for me, and me being me, I always wanted to know how it works.</description>

      <description>Umm right before we start I&amp;rsquo;d like to say that I might make some very stupid mistakes in the process of solving these problems, I hope that&amp;rsquo;s not going to be a problem, I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about it here.
Now then, off we go!
The question The problem heading states: Convert hex to base64. I am expecting a bit (pun not inteded) of binary arithematic for this one. According to the problem statement, we will have to convert a hexadecimal string given to us into its base64 equivalent.</description>
