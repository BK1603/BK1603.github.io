      <description>I recently received a call from my room mate. He asked me about how he could access the &amp;ldquo;Study Material&amp;rdquo; shared folder from our college, mentioning that the college had sent us a file with directions for setting it up, (which I was blissfully unaware of, honestly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less about the classes starting right now :/)
Well, upon opening the file I did find some instructions, BUT they are only for windows.</description>
