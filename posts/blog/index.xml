			<description>I recently received a call from my room mate. He asked me about how he could access the &amp;ldquo;Study Material&amp;rdquo; shared folder from our college, mentioning that the college had sent us a file with directions for setting it up, (which I was blissfully unaware of, honestly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less about the classes starting right now :/)
Well, upon opening the file I did find some instructions, BUT they are only for windows.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently received a call from my room mate. He asked me about how he could access the &ldquo;Study Material&rdquo;
shared folder from our college, mentioning that the college had sent us a file with directions for setting
it up, (which I was blissfully unaware of, honestly I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the classes starting right now
:/)</p>
<p>Well, upon opening the file I did find some instructions, BUT they are only for windows. (I don&rsquo;t know
what to say. I really don&rsquo;t.) For all the good peeps running linux, here&rsquo;s my guide on how to set it up.</p>
<p>PS: Of course I could have just called my room mate up and told him the entire thing. Heck I could
even have logged in on his laptop via ssh and done it all by myself, but this blog desparately needs posts
right now and I am running behind on my write ups, since I got bit busy for the past three months or so. So
I thought to myself, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for">Who is this guide for?</h2>
<p>Anyone using linux who hasn&rsquo;t been able to accesss the &ldquo;Study Material&rdquo; shared folder on their sytsems
because of the absence of instructions and the cryptic nature of the files downloaded. (The configuration
file ends with a <code>.ovpn</code>, and when I first looked at such a file a year ago, it made absolutely no sense
to me whatsoever.) I&rsquo;ll try and explain why we are doing what we are doing too so if you&rsquo;re interested in
that do read it to the end.</p>
<p>Lastly I hope this works with Macbooks too. Honestly I am too poor to be able to afford one and test it
out. Do let me know if it doesn&rsquo;t work though, I&rsquo;ll try and help to the best of my abilities.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After a 30 minute long discussion with <a href="https://github.com/thedevastateddreamer">Divya</a>, turns out the config file provided by our college
won&rsquo;t work as is on mac. Bummer :(</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install openvpn on your distribution. For most of you it should be:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo apt install openvpn
</code></pre><p>(Others can refer to the documentation of their distributions on how to use their package managers.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://14.139.238.98:8180/userportal/webpages/myaccount/login.jsp">the link mentioned in the pdf</a> and login using the Sophos
password. (Yes that Sophos password. Took me 7 tries.)</li>
<li>Download the configuration files for other OS. You should get a file with the folowing name format (other OSs):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;enrollment_number&gt;@pdc.jiit__ssl_vpn_config.ovpn
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Open the downloaded file with your favorite editor. For me it&rsquo;ll be like this on the terminal:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>edit ~/Downloads/18103150@pdc.jiit__ssl_vpn_config
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Search for the line <code>comp-lzo no</code> and replace it with <code>compress lzo</code></li>
<li>Run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo openvpn --config ~/Downloads/&lt;enrollment_number&gt;@pdc.jiit__ssl_vpn_config.ovpn
</code></pre><p>(You&rsquo;ll have to leave this running for the entire time you need to access the server. Quit it via <code>&lt;Ctrl-c&gt;</code>
when you&rsquo;re done, and run it again everytime you need to access the folder.)</p>
<ul>
<li>It will ask you for the root password. Enter that.</li>
<li>It will then ask you for the Sophos username and password. Type that in.</li>
<li>Open your file manager.</li>
<li>Most have a connect to server/remote network in the left side tray at the very bottom.</li>
<li>Enter this ip adress in the server field: <code>172.16.68.30</code>. (From the pdf given to us by our college.)</li>
<li>Set the port to <code>8443</code>.</li>
<li>Add the username and passwords in there respective feilds, and leave everything else as is.</li>
</ul>
<p>And voila! You should be up and running! If this is all that you came for then there you go. If you faced
any problems in the above steps, try and follow along, I&rsquo;ll try and explain why we are doing what we
are doing. Maybe that helps? If that didn&rsquo;t try and reach out and I&rsquo;ll try my best to help you.</p>
<h2 id="cool-but-why">Cool but, why?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an explanation for the steps for anyone curious about it. (Or people who don&rsquo;t want to do crap
to their systems without having a solid reason why. Eg: The minimalists, the security freaks and what not.)
I&rsquo;ll try and keep this concise so that I only describe absolutely what&rsquo;s necessary for this to work. You
can read the man pages of the tools used for more info.</p>
<p><strong>!!!Disclaimer!!!</strong>: I am no expert on networks and I won&rsquo;t be explaining any network related stuff here.
I&rsquo;ll explain only the things that are needed to understand the steps we took.</p>
<h3 id="the-downloaded-file">The downloaded file</h3>
<p>The file we downloaded is a config file for <code>openvpn</code>. What is OpenVPN? I&rsquo;ll leave that to you guys. A simple
google search would help you with that. You can checkout the <code>man</code> page for <code>openvpn</code> too. What the config
file does is tells the openvpn client, (running on our machine,) about where the request made to a specific
address are supposed to go. In our case, it decides where does a request made on <code>172.16.68.30</code> actually
goes. It does that by adding routes to the route table, and some other stuff that I am not gonna go into
since I am no expert on networks as I just said, and also because I don&rsquo;t think that those details
are relevant here.</p>
<p>When we run <code>openvpn</code> with the config file, whenever a packet is to be sent to the IP adress <code>172.16.68.30</code>
it is sent to the openvpn client, which compresses, encrypts and looks up the route table and sends
the file to where it&rsquo;s supposed to be sent via a secure tunnel. Detailed explanation <a href="https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/site-to-site-routing-explained-in-detail/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-comp-lzo-voodoo">The &ldquo;comp-lzo&rdquo; voodoo</h3>
<p>The OpenVPN client needs to know whether the server will be expecting compressed packets. If the server
is infact accepting compressed packets, the client would then require the compression algorithm that
the server is expecting. In our case it is the <code>lzo</code> algorithm. In the config file we have <code>comp-lzo</code> set
to <code>no</code>.</p>
<p>Now two things, first, we need the lzo compression. If we run it as is, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Bad compression stub decompression header byte: 102
</code></pre><p>Which I am guessing means that the decompression resulted in an unknown header byte that caused this error,
or simply we are using the wrong compression algorithm.</p>
<p>Second, <code>comp-lzo</code> is a deprecated flag. It will soon be removed from OpenVPN. It has been replaced by
the <code>compress</code> flag. You simply write the name of the algorithm after the <code>compress</code> flag for it to work.
In our case it would be <code>compress lzo</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-it">The rest of it</h3>
<p>The rest of it is just us basically whatever the prompt asks us to. One question that remains unanswered
is how was the port number found. Well it&rsquo;s there among the last lines of the <code>ovpn</code> file that we downloaded.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well there you go. That should be it. If there are any problems, you can try reaching out via email or gitter. My gitter userhandle is BK1603. I&rsquo;ll try and help you out as much as possible. Also I hope
that all of you are staying safe and doing well!</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ll try and add a comments section soon enough, I&rsquo;ve been partly busy and partly lazy about it.)</p>

			<title>Cryptopals</title>

			<description>What&amp;rsquo;s this? Well, since I have a bit of free time on my hands these days, I am thinking of learing a bit about cryptography. I am always amazed at the way we manipulate strings of bits and bytes in cryptography, to hide a message. That too in plain sight. It always has been a very fascinating thing for me, and me being me, I always wanted to know how it works.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-this">What&rsquo;s this?</h2>
<p>Well, since I have a bit of free time on my hands these days, I am thinking of learing a bit about cryptography.
I am always amazed at the way we manipulate strings of bits and bytes in cryptography, to hide a message. That too
in plain sight. It always has been a very fascinating thing for me, and me being me, I always wanted to know how it works.
So, upon searching for some resources, I came accross this amazing website, <a href="https://www.cryptopals.com">cryptopals.com</a>. More on it coming right up!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cryptopalscom">What is cryptopals.com?</h2>
<p>It is a website (duh) that has a collection of problems on cryptography. According to the introduction written over there,
the site is meant to be used as a learning resource, and I don&rsquo;t know about you guys but I definitely love learning about stuff by doing it.
The website states that no prerequisite knowledge of crypto or maths, (maths that is taught beyond grade 9 to be exact) is required.</p>
<h2 id="whats-so-good-about-this">What&rsquo;s so good about this?</h2>
<p>Just the fact that this will help me learn cryptography by doing crypto stuff is enough a reason for
me to immediately start solving some problems over there. The site mentions that the challenges are made to be
incrementally hard, with the ones in set one being very easy. They even say that if you&rsquo;ve done even a little bit of cryptography
before hand you should be able to complete the first set in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Well, I am just gonna say that I know myself. And I do NOT know cryptography. And it is definitely gonna take hours if not days to
solve each problem.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-gonna-write-about-and-whats-so-special-about-that">What are you gonna write about? And what&rsquo;s so special about that?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So well, I googled, cryptopals set x problem x solution, and a bunch of solutions showed up, why should I read this?&rdquo;, I hear you say.
Well as of the time that I started writing this blog, I couldn&rsquo;t find a detailed walkthrough of the problems. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was
looking for the solutions of relatively easy problems. There might always be better solutions and guides out there. But in this blog I&rsquo;d
like to show we can learn about cryptography from scratch. Since I am an absolute beginner myself, I believe that I can describe the
problems that a lot of people like me might face. I will list all the resources that helped me along the way.</p>
<p>And well I am in no way saying that my writeups will be a good walkthrough for all these problems, that&rsquo;s definitely not true. There are
a lot of people out there who are way better than me at both blogging and cryptography, and they will be writing both better blogs and
walkthroughs to these problems. All that I am saying is that, this set of writeups are gonna show how a total noob as myself can start
learing anything that he/she wants, and get better at them. (Other than that these posts will also serve as a gauge for my improvement,
since I do not expect a lot of people following these blogs. The count is 0 for now. And you can call me crazy for talking to myself
like this. But I think that I will have company soon.)</p>
<p>Also I will be posting the code for the solutions to these problems at
<a href="https://github.com/BK1603/cryptopals-solutions">my repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Well, to the people following these blogs, (and the ones who stumble upon this in the future, ) who already know a bit of cryptography,
(don&rsquo;t know what you guys are doing here, but thanks anyways,) it might happen that I start solving a problem with the stupidest
way possible. Just bear with me, I know I am kinda dumb, but I am a good learner too. (That&rsquo;s what my mom says anyways.) Things should get better
with each problem that I solve.</p>

			<title>First Blog</title>

			<description>What is this blog for? I&amp;rsquo;ll use this blog for writing about my adventures in open source. The issues that I fixed and how I fixed them. I might also write about how various open source softwares work &amp;ldquo;under the hood&amp;rdquo;. You know the good stuff ;)
I&amp;rsquo;ll try and write about any security vulnerabilities that I might find in open source softwares. Although this is a long shot, but well, if I do find something, I might as well write about how I found it.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ll use this blog for writing about my adventures in open source. The
issues that I fixed and how I fixed them. I might also write about how
various open source softwares work &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;. You know the good
stuff ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and write about any security vulnerabilities that I might find
in open source softwares. Although this is a long shot, but well,
if I do find something, I might as well write about how I found it.</p>
<p>Other than that I will write about any interesting stuff that I come across.
Though most of it would be just how things work. Like how are files
represented in memory, or how does virtual memory work. How does
various network protocols work and so on and so forth. You get the idea
right?</p>
<p>I hope this makes up for an interesting blog, and that it helps every one
who loves knowing about stuff like I do. :)</p>
<p>Also most of this blog would be divided in various &ldquo;categories&rdquo; using tags.
You can find them at the end of each post. Hope you enjoy your stay here!</p>
